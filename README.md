My version of this is in the file demo/oauth.pl

Use server. To run the code, you need to have a local copy of the client secrets json
file and have your google app set up correctly.

Use google chrome and browse localhost:5000 and show the javascript console
to see the token.


# SWI-Prolog code for "Login with Google"





This pack deals with "Login With   Google"  using [OpenID Connect (OAuth
2.0                                                                  for
Login)](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenIDConnect).  The
code is partially based on
[pl-oauth2client-for-google](https://github.com/xpxaxsxi/pl-oauth2client-for-google)

To run the code

  1. Follow these
  [steps](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenIDConnect) to
  create a Google project and get

     - A client ID
     - A client secret
     - Register a redirect url.  To test from localhost, this should be
       `http://localhost:3040/oauth2/auth_redirect`

  2. Edit `demo/test.pl`, fill in the client id and client secret. Start
  Prolog with `demo/test.pl` and run the command below to start the
  server.

     ```{prolog}
     ?- server.
     ```

  3. Go to `http://localhost:3040` and hit the button.  After logging in
  this should show a Prolog dict holding the Google profile information.
